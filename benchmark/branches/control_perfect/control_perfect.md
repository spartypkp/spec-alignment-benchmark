# Branch: control_perfect

## Purpose
Control test for false positive rate and baseline behavior. This branch has **ZERO misalignments** - the code perfectly matches the specification. Tests whether frameworks incorrectly report problems that don't exist.

## Configuration
- **Total Misalignments**: 0
- **Type 1 (Missing)**: 0
- **Type 2 (Incorrect)**: 0
- **Type 3 (Extraneous)**: 0
- **Purpose**: Establish false positive baseline

---

## Critical Importance

This control branch serves as the scientific baseline by testing:

1. **False Positive Rate**: Any reported misalignment is a false positive
2. **Confidence Accuracy**: Frameworks should be highly confident
3. **Search Termination**: Frameworks should conclude "no issues found"
4. **Interpretation Consistency**: Both frameworks should agree
5. **Time Baseline**: How long to verify perfect alignment

---

## What This Branch Tests

### Expected Behavior
- Report zero misalignments
- High confidence in assessment
- Complete but efficient search
- Clear "all good" conclusion

### Problematic Behavior (Red Flags)
- Reporting any misalignments (false positives)
- Low confidence despite perfect alignment
- Endless searching for non-existent problems
- Inventing issues or being overly pedantic

---

## Common False Positive Traps

Areas where frameworks might incorrectly report issues:

1. **Best Practices vs Requirements**
   - "Should have error handling" (when spec doesn't require it)
   - "Missing tests" (when spec doesn't mention testing)
   - "No rate limiting" (when spec doesn't specify it)

2. **Implementation Details**
   - "Using SQLite instead of PostgreSQL" (spec says SQLite)
   - "No environment variables" (spec says none needed)
   - "Missing TypeScript types" (when they exist)

3. **Interpretation Differences**
   - "Spec implies X" (when it doesn't explicitly state X)
   - "Standard practice suggests Y" (beyond spec requirements)
   - "Could be more secure" (meeting spec security requirements)

## Ground Truth Summary

```json
{
  "test_branch": "control_perfect",
  "specification_file": "specs/project-specification.md",
  "type1_missing": [],
  "type2_incorrect": [],
  "type3_extraneous": []
}
```

## Implementation Checklist

When creating this branch:

- [ ] Create branch from main: `git checkout -b control_perfect`
- [ ] Verify code matches spec perfectly (it should already)
- [ ] Do NOT make any changes
- [ ] Save ground-truth.json to branch (empty arrays)
- [ ] Commit with message: "Control branch - perfect alignment"

## Scoring Implications

### Metrics Affected
```python
# Any detection is a false positive
if len(framework_output["misalignments"]) > 0:
    false_positive_count = len(framework_output["misalignments"])
    precision_penalty = significant

# Confidence should be high
if framework_confidence < 0.8:
    confidence_calibration_issue = True

# Time should be reasonable
if execution_time > median_time * 1.5:
    efficiency_issue = True
```

### Impact on Final Scores
- False positives here heavily penalize overall precision
- Low confidence here indicates calibration problems
- Excessive time here suggests inefficient search

---

## Expected Outcomes by Framework

**If Cursor tends toward completeness:**
- Might report more false positives
- Could flag "missing" best practices
- May take longer searching for issues

**If Claude Code tends toward precision:**
- Should report zero issues confidently
- Might be more conservative
- Could complete search faster

---

## Why This Matters

Without this control:
- Can't calculate true false positive rate
- Can't assess confidence calibration
- Can't identify over-detection tendencies
- Can't establish baseline behavior

This branch is **essential** for scientific validity. It's the "null hypothesis" test that validates all other results.

## Analysis Questions

After running this control test:
1. Did either framework report false positives?
2. What types of false positives were reported?
3. How confident were the frameworks?
4. How long did verification take?
5. Did frameworks agree on "perfect alignment"?

The answers reveal fundamental characteristics about how each framework approaches specification analysis.
